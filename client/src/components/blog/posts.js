        body1: `Politikos has been launched, that there's plenty of work to be done
        moving forward.`,
        body2: `So far on the site, you're able to look up your local representatives
        and go to a feed, where the politikos community can make posts about, collaborate,
        and make comments.  There is also a feature where you can vote on the legitimacy
        of an post.`,
        body3: `This feature stays loyal to philosophical ideals about fact-checking. One
        will notice that there is no way to say "0%" or "100%."  This is because the whole
        truth will always be- at most- a hair's length away.  Conceptually, what we're really
        doing here is giving a user an idea of how factual a post is through seeing the 
        opinions of others. It's not perfect, and nothing is.`,
        body4: `The logic hasn't been written yet to show the user an average of the overall
        community vote.  Today, on this day, there is one user.  Me. :) However, this is a 
        feature that is at the front of the line to implement for the future.`,
        body5: `The other features that need to be implemented soon is for a user to edit their
        own posts and comments.  These are currently at the top of my to-do list.`,
