        body1: `I have added the ability for the client to delete their own posts and 
        comments.  This was a critical feature that I wanted to finish.  Now, anyone who
        is looking at the site can feel free to test out the functions without feeling
        like their work is going to be permanently etched in the database.`,
        body2: `The delete button will appear in the upper right corner of the user's posts
        and comments if they so choose to delete their work.  My next goal along these lines-
        though not a priority- would be to implement an update/edit feature so that the user
        doesn't have to delete their entire post just because they made one silly mistake.`,

        body1: `Politikos has been launched, that there's plenty of work to be done
        moving forward.`,
        body2: `So far on the site, you're able to look up your local representatives
        and go to a feed, where the politikos community can make posts about, collaborate,
        and make comments.  There is also a feature where you can vote on the legitimacy
        of an post.`,
        body3: `This feature stays loyal to philosophical ideals about fact-checking. One
        will notice that there is no way to say "0%" or "100%."  This is because the whole
        truth will always be- at most- a hair's length away.  Conceptually, what we're really
        doing here is giving a user an idea of how factual a post is through seeing the 
        opinions of others. It's not perfect, and nothing is.`,
        body4: `The logic hasn't been written yet to show the user an average of the overall
        community vote.  Today, on this day, there is one user.  Me. :) However, this is a 
        feature that is at the front of the line to implement for the future.`,
        body5: `The other features that need to be implemented soon is for a user to edit their
        own posts and comments.  These are currently at the top of my to-do list.`,
